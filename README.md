# My Advent of code solutions
This repository contains some of my solutions to [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)
2023 and now 2024.

## What is it?
This is taken from the official [about page](https://adventofcode.com/about) of the event:\
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People 
use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice 
problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
