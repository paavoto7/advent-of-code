# My Advent of code solutions
This repository contains some of my solutions to [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)
2022, 2023, 2024 and now 2025.

## How to run
### 2025
Using make is preferred, for usage reference see to [Makefile](./Makefile).
One can also use the [run.sh](./run.sh) bash script.

### Other years
For 2024 and 2022, use the `run.sh` in their respective directories. I intend to
add support for those in the Makefile.

Running 2023 can be simply be run with python: `python3 2023/dayN/dayN.py`

## Input files
Puzzle inputs are not saved here due to the rules of the event. "If you're posting
a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the
puzzle text or your inputs." (AoC [about page](https://adventofcode.com/about))

## What is it?
This is taken from the official [about page](https://adventofcode.com/about) of the event:\
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People 
use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice 
problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
