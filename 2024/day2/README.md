Part 1 was extremely easy.\
I tried multiple approaches and failed for trying to be too clever in part 2.\
I tried building solutions that didn't have to create all sublists and so on.\
They worked for the examples and I now know that few of them were roughly 10 away from the correct answer.\
This solution that works is horribly inefficient, but luckily the sample size is small and this year I'm using C++ :).\
Note to self: an iffecient solution is better than an optimal one that doesn't work.
