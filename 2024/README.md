My solutions to some of the [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 puzzles with 
hopefully C++ and if not that, then Python.

I have have very minimal experience in C++. If I miss some standard library
functions or data structures it is because I'm only just learning the language.

I try to refactor the code to make it faster and overall better after initially 
solving both puzzles of a day.

Some are quite janky, some are better. Some are more optimized, some less.

Puzzle inputs are not saved here due to the rules of the event.
